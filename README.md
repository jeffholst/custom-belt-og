👋 Howdy and welcome!

If you're interested in the [demo](https://jeffholst.github.io/custom-belt/demo.html) and [documentation](https://jeffholst.github.io/custom-belt/introduction/what-is-custom-belt.html) project for [vue-custom-belt](https://github.com/jeffholst/vue-custom-belt) then you are in the right place. Otherwise you may want to visit the [vue-custom-belt](https://github.com/jeffholst/vue-custom-belt) repo.

[vue-custom-belt](https://github.com/jeffholst/vue-custom-belt) is a Vue 3 component to easily create any style martial arts belt in SVG format.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

If the standalone TypeScript plugin doesn't feel fast enough to you, Volar has also implemented a [Take Over Mode](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471#discussioncomment-1361669) that is more performant. You can enable it by the following steps:

1. Disable the built-in TypeScript Extension
    1) Run `Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions` from VSCode's command palette
    2) Find `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features`, right click and select `Disable (Workspace)`
2. Reload the VSCode window by running `Developer: Reload Window` from the command palette.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).
